## Run instructions

```bash
node md-script.js <target-dir>
```

where `<target-dir>` is relative path to directory that needs to be cleaned up compared to the current script's path. For example, if you are running it from inside this `cleanup-wiki` folder, then the command would be something like:

```bash
node md-script.js ../msnews-experiences
```
